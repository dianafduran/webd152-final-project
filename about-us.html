            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                Pacific Trails Resort is the best resort in California due to its exceptional history and all of the well earned successes it has acquired thanks to our magnificent staff and family.
                Our founder, Ms. Crystal Bettencourt started the resort on June 11th of 2003 with only a 9m x 4m pool, 3 rooms and only one tour guide who was her son Mr. Andrew Goldman. 
                Hard work and determination was what made the resort survive all these years, and Ms. Bettencourt -a single mother at the time- was well known for that. 
            </p>
            <h3>Our People</h3>
            <p>At present, our staff consists of 150 amazing individuals whom we value more than gold. They make everything about our resort be a thousand times better and they are the most warm, and welcoming staff who go above and beyond to make sure our customers' needs are met every single time. 
                We have a specialized human resources team who make sure to hire the nicest and most hard working people possible. A proud and loving family is just one more of the many perks you'll find by reserving your stay at Pacific Trails Resort!
